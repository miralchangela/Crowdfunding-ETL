# Crowdfunding analysis using ETL:

## Overview of the analysis:
-  Here we use the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process to create data pipelines. A data pipeline moves data from a source to a destination. The ETL process creates a data pipeline that also transforms the data along the way.
- The Crowdfunding analysis follows this steps:
  (1) Create an ETL pipeline that moves raw data to a SQL database.
  (2) Extract data from an external file by using Python and Pandas.
  (3) Clean and transform data by using Python and Pandas.
  (4) Design a database and a table schema by using an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
  (5) Load data into a PostgreSQL database.
  (6) Perform data analysis by using SQL queries.

## Extract the data:
* Here the [crowdfunding excel] source file which is used for extracting the data into fout separate CSV files such as campaign, contacts, category and subcategory.
* [Backer_info] file is used for extracting the clean data of backer information which includes backer id , first name , last name and email.
